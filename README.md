Anonymization Test
=================

This repository contains a few test projects to test how to integrate an ML
model for anonymizing images into an Android App.
This projects serves as a template for the integration within the Cyface App
itself and was initially developed to integrate the Anonymization developed
on University of Leipzig in the DiGuRaL research project into Cyface Image
Capturing Technology.

Test1
-----

The first try of getting an ML model to run within an Android App. This project
has rather wild code and several trys using different technologies.

Test2
-----

This is a test project to get a quick solution using an exisitng Tensorflow lite
model, bot not the one from Leipzig.
It was developed to get a fast solution for the first test actual test run.

Test3
-----

A second try to integrate the model from the University of Leipzig with an
Android App.
This version tries to reach a much cleaner implementation based on the lessons
learned from Test1 and Test2.
